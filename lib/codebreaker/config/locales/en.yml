            1 - Codebreaker is a logic game in which a code-breaker tries to break a secret code created
                        by a code-maker.
                        The codemaker, which will be played by the application we're going to write,
                        creates a secret code of four numbers between %{correct_range_first} and %{correct_range_last}.

            2 - The codebreaker gets some number of chances to break the code (depends on chosen difficulty).
            In each turn, the codebreaker makes a guess of %{length_good} numbers.
            The codemaker then marks the guess with up to %{length_good} signs - + or - or empty spaces.

            3 - A + indicates an exact match: one of the numbers in the guess is the same as one of the numbers in
                                                                      the secret code and in the same position.
            For example:
              Secret number - 1234
              Input number - 6264
              Number of pluses - 2 (second and fourth position)

            4 - A - indicates a number match: one of the numbers in the guess is the same as one of the numbers in
                                                                    the secret code but in a different position.
            For example:
              Secret number - 1234
              Input number - 6462
              Number of minuses - 2 (second and fourth position)

            5 - An empty space indicates that there is not a current digit in a secret number.

            6 - If codebreaker inputs the exact number as a secret number - codebreaker wins the game.
                If all attempts are spent - codebreaker loses.
            7 - Codebreaker also has some number of hints(depends on chosen difficulty).
                If a user takes a hint - he receives back a separate digit of the secret code.
